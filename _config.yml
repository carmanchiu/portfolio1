user_description: Hi there! Iâ€™ve recently completed a Full-Stack Software Development Apprenticeship Program at Discovery Partners Institute after pivoting from the healthcare field as a Medical Laboratory Scientist. My passions lie in healthcare and technology. I'm continually learning and building upon knowledge within those two fields, and I hope to use my skills to create a positive impact on others and contribute to a more advanced world.
